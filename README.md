# Gesture_Recognition_Based_Virtual_Mouse

The purpose of this project is to allow people with early stages of 
Parkinson's disease to use the laptop/computer without using the 
physical mouse. By showing certain gestures, the user can 
replicate the mouse functions such as free cursor movement, 
left/right click, scrolling up/down, and double click. Besides that, 
the user can also control their laptop's/computer's brightness and 
volume by showing certain gestures as well. The gesture 
detection is done by transfer learning approach, where Yolov5 
model that has been trained using custom dataset and it will 
trigger the respective actions.
